For this reason, we are trying to raise some funds to re-instate the wildlife pond that he was passionate about. It was one of the projects he was planning to do before he passed and as a nod to him, we want to complete this. To do this we need to empty to water out of the pond as itâ€™s stagnant. Clean out the pond and re-fill it. There are a few trees that need to come down around the pond as well. We were hoping to install some walkways so help children assess the pond for pond dipping to help with education. This will also help local wildlife and have a positive effect on the fauna and flour of the forest school area. As you can imagine this is a costly project to do and any help would be amazing.\n",
