However, all of the strategies we are implementing will support staff to have a deeper, more curious understanding of behaviour and the needs of the students we have now and in the future especially with our changing cohort. This links in closely with our values and our why and is really important. I am leading on Thrive in terms of Senior Leadership as I see it as the golden thread linking many other aspects of our school improvement work.

I have a secure senior leadership team, and we work well together and are aligned but also able to challenge. I am finding it rewarding watching it all come together. Even though there have been significant challenges with the Local Authority with RAS funding, inappropriate placements and Connected Provision Decommissioning which is really stressful and challenging I feel that I have been more resilient in managing these challenges and can feel the support from the staff when communicating key messages.  I feel that there has been greater clarity of expectations for leaders as we have worked our way through the changes within the team and adjusted to new leaders joining the team. (Ryan, Sophia, Siobhan) I think that this is starting to filter down to middle leaders too (Sadie & Kate new to role) and this is driving school improvements more efficiently. The structure of our leadership meetings are definitely more strategic than they have ever been and this in turn is supporting leadership development, collaboration and accountability. The return of an AHT who has been on secondment needs navigating and to be thought through especially in context of the decommissioning of Connected Provision and Four Seasons.  \n",
      "Governorsâ€™ commentary:\n",
      "We reflected on the journey Tracy has taken since she took up Headship four years ago, and how much more confident she has grown because of her deep commitment to values led leadership and a values led educational offer.  Tracy doesnâ€™t like to talk about herself, and she doesnâ€™t like to take credit for the substantial achievements she makes term on term because she has built up such a strong leadership team who deliver her vision.  But without her vision the steady improvements in the schoolâ€™s offer would not have happened. What has been listed above against Headteacher Standards describes a lot of her work since September, building on the solid standards she has already achieved across the school.\n",
      "\n",
      "Currently Tracy has two main foci.  One is developing the Relationships/behaviour policy and turning around staff thinking about relationships and behaviour.  She has addressed the legal requirements and is now gaining the voice of the staff in writing the policy.  The other main focus is the changing profile of the studentsâ€™ needs with an expanding number of pupils in Pathways 1 & 2.  This requires retraining of staff to equip them with the pedagogical and planning skills for these students.  She is concentrating on sharing the message and vision with staff.\n",
      "\n",
      "A significant recent development by the SLT has been a comprehensive approach to Quality Assurance, and as the recent Safeguarding Deep dive shows, together with the evidence Tracy has sent for this review, this has led to some high-quality self-evaluation and reflection in all areas of the schoolâ€™s offer leading to next steps for improvement.  This is best practice to share with other schools.\n",
      "\n",
      "A vast amount of Tracyâ€™s time currently is being taken up with discussions with the LA about funding and RAS levels.  This has given her a much deeper insight into the schoolâ€™s budget and funding per class.  She has to fight for additional funding for students with complex needs as the LA view is that the school is responsible for deploying its funding and put significant pressure on the use of AP when the money is already spent on in school provision.\n",

According to researchers, the proportion of children and young people reporting mental health issues has grown six times in England in just two decades. The Mental Health Foundation recommend a number of ways to help keep our schoolchildren healthy. Suggestions include â€˜eating a balanced diet and getting regular exerciseâ€™, â€˜having time and freedom to play, indoors and outdoorsâ€™, and â€˜going to a school that looks after the well being of all its pupilsâ€™. Gardening gives us a sense of responsibility and purpose and as such, encourages feelings of self-worth. It is also fantastic exercise, releasing dopamine, serotonin and endorphins that make us feel good. And the mindful nature of it allows us to focus on the task at hand, living in the present moment rather than being distracted by potentially anxious or uncomfortable thoughts.\n",

      "The Edible Playground will initially be developed by our Forest School leader who will work with groups of children from year 5 and 6 to train them as EP leaders. The idea is that these children will then share their knowledge with younger pupils to enable them to take responsibility for the care of the area and plants. This will build the capacity to sustain the project for future pupils at Kemble. All children will be encouraged to enjoy the playground and to participate in the growing and harvest of produce as well as the cooking / eating.

As a setting our ethos is to be nature inspired whilst using the curiosity approach with the added extras of colour etc. The children love spending time in the garden and enjoy planting and tending for the plants whilst also looking at the nature around. We have a wildlife garden which is in great need for a massive do over due to it being overgrown also - in here we have a pond, which was once home to many frogs!   \n",

       "4  Our school is passionate about hands-on learning, and gardening is a perfect way to engage students with nature, science, and sustainability. Your gardening bundles would help us create an interactive garden space where students can grow their own fruits, vegetables, and flowers. This experience will teach responsibility, patience, and teamwork while reinforcing lessons in biology and environmental care. With your support, we could expand our garden with tools, seeds, and educational resources, making gardening accessible for all students. These bundles would inspire young minds, fostering a love for nature and healthy living while strengthening our school community.   \n",

       "      <td>Greetings from our SEN school Harford Manor in Norwich. We are a school with 100 students who have profound learning and developmental disabilities that significantly impact our daily lives. Our parents and staff have formed a charity to support us, The Friends of Harford Manor. They work hard to raise funds to replace old equipment or items we break on accident which the schools limited budget cannot cover. As our charity is run 100% by volunteers every single penny goes to helping improve our quality of life. It is a challenge for SEN school to raise funds as many of our students live in various parts of the county. Any funds raised can could help us build a shelter for the back of classrooms to keep us dry or even for therapeutic resources that help us regulate throughout the school day. We often find ourselves competing with larger schools or academies with larger budgets and more resources, so every penny raised feels like a tiny miracle for us. We could really use funds at the moment to improve our school hall or to buy new swing seats for the secondary play area as the current ones are old, worn out, and ruining our students clothing with dark stains. Any help you could provide would be endlessly grateful for!'</td>\n",

We have children with ADHD, Autism, have suffered or witnessed violence so calming equipment like lights, fidgets that are tactile, cushions, theraputty, pencil grips, rugs and blankets. These would have a huge impact so that we can give more kids the equipment they need. The amount of children with additional needs has increased dramatically and we struggle to get everything we need to support them. It would also mean we can place our existing funds in to other SEND applications. I just want to see the kids get what they need and deserve at a school that is very short on budget and kids who have no home support to have to have that extra in school. Children who have nothing would get that little bit to increase value at school'</td>\n",

New books will help us enrich the classroom and provide a safe space for them to relax and lose themselves for a while if the demands of being back at school get too much!

       "6  Greetings from our SEN school Harford Manor in Norwich. We are a school with 100 students who have profound learning and developmental disabilities that significantly impact our daily lives. Our parents and staff have formed a charity to support us, The Friends of Harford Manor. They work hard to raise funds to replace old equipment or items we break on accident which the schools limited budget cannot cover. As our charity is run 100% by volunteers every single penny goes to helping improve our quality of life. It is a challenge for SEN school to raise funds as many of our students live in various parts of the county. Any funds raised can could help us build a shelter for the back of classrooms to keep us dry or even for therapeutic resources that help us regulate throughout the school day. We often find ourselves competing with larger schools or academies with larger budgets and more resources, so every penny raised feels like a tiny miracle for us. We could really use funds at the moment to improve our school hall or to buy new swing seats for the secondary play area as the current ones are old, worn out, and ruining our students clothing with dark stains. Any help you could provide would be endlessly grateful for!'   \n",

We have children with ADHD, Autism, have suffered or witnessed violence so calming equipment like lights, fidgets that are tactile, cushions, theraputty, pencil grips, rugs and blankets. These would have a huge impact so that we can give more kids the equipment they need. The amount of children with additional needs has increased dramatically and we struggle to get everything we need to support them. It would also mean we can place our existing funds in to other SEND applications. I just want to see the kids get what they need and deserve at a school that is very short on budget and kids who have no home support to have to have that extra in school. Children who have nothing would get that little bit to increase value at school'   \n",

Many of our students face significant challenges in communication and emotional expression. Art is a powerful tool that allows them to process feelings, build confidence, and develop essential life skills. With your support, we would purchase paints, canvases, clay, and sketchbooks to run the Arts Award program. This would give our students a creative voice and a sense of achievement. Additionally, we could bring in an art therapist weekly, providing vital emotional support. Your funding would transform lives, giving these children hope and opportunity.   \n",

We have a large area and would love to be able to give it a full makeover! As a setting our ethos is to be nature inspired whilst using the curiosity approach with the added extras of colour etc. The children love spending time in the garden and enjoy planting and tending for the plants whilst also looking at the nature around. We have a wildlife garden which is in great need for a massive do over due to it being overgrown also - in here we have a pond, which was once home to many frogs!   \n",

Your gardening bundles would help us create an interactive garden space where students can grow their own fruits, vegetables, and flowers. This experience will teach responsibility, patience, and teamwork while reinforcing lessons in biology and environmental care. With your support, we could expand our garden with tools, seeds, and educational resources, making gardening accessible for all students. These bundles would inspire young minds, fostering a love for nature and healthy living while strengthening our school community.   \n",

       "1002  We have climate change and the environment at our core at our school. We have fantastic Eco Warriors and very keen children. We litter pick, we recycle including food and we have next steps to compost and improve our green areas. We have planted up smaller pots around school with our wildlife club's aid and we are looking next to improve and further our forest area. It is a small area but we would love to really boost the area so it can be used for learning and thrive as a minority woodland. We have further steps to bring back to life our sensory garden, hopefully with help from the wildlife club and Eco committee to maintain it, allowing the children to enjoy it through the summer and the Send and behavioural children to access it for sensory relief and calming throughout the day. We would love to get some shade onto our field area as our new secure fencing meant some of our little trees had to come down. Whether that be with new trees or for now shade sails, but we would love to create some willow tree hideouts and tunnels. There's a lot we would love to do on our Green journey. Any little would help as we start to bring sustainability and our environment into our focus in the classroom learning as well as in our day to day living at our school.   \n",

These items would be a great bonus for us as we have limited resources and funding to purchase these in our budget . Our garden patch would be blossoming once again and the children will learn about planting growing and harvesting techniques. Many of these children live in flats or with no access to gardens . In addition there are many parents  who are not aware of the importance of growing . This will increase their knowledge and understanding of the world and help the environment   \n",

I currently pay for as much as possible. We have now got an allotment area, but really need some help with filling it!! We are trying hard to run outdoor learning sessions, as we have so many children without gardens who live in converted shipping containers and their faces when they tackle ceratin skills and plant and see things grow is beautiful. please please help us!!!  \n",
       "4  Our school is passionate about hands-on learning, and gardening is a perfect way to engage students with nature, science, and sustainability. Your gardening bundles would help us create an interactive garden space where students can grow their own fruits, vegetables, and flowers. This experience will teach responsibility, patience, and teamwork while reinforcing lessons in biology and environmental care. With your support, we could expand our garden with tools, seeds, and educational resources, making gardening accessible for all students. These bundles would inspire young minds, fostering a love for nature and healthy living while strengthening our school community.  "

I currently pay for as much as possible. We have now got an allotment area, but really need some help with filling it!! We are trying hard to run outdoor learning sessions, as we have so many children without gardens who live in converted shipping containers and their faces when they tackle ceratin skills and plant and see things grow is beautiful. please please help us!!!  \n",
       "4          Our school is passionate about hands-on learning, and gardening is a perfect way to engage students with nature, science, and sustainability. Your gardening bundles would help us create an interactive garden space where students can grow their own fruits, vegetables, and flowers. This experience will teach responsibility, patience, and teamwork while reinforcing lessons in biology and environmental care. With your support, we could expand our garden with tools, seeds, and educational resources, making gardening accessible for all students. These bundles would inspire young minds, fostering a love for nature and healthy living while strengthening our school community.  \n",

Gardening bundles would enrich our curriculum by providing practical experiences in nature, promoting teamwork, and teaching responsibility. These bundles would support our children in understanding plant life cycles, environmental stewardship, and healthy eating habits. Your resources could help us create engaging outdoor activities, enhancing sensory development and fine motor skills. We aim to inspire young gardeners and instill a lifelong love for nature. Your support would be invaluable in nurturing our children's growth and learning. ?  \n",

We made posters about the process and even chose an area to grow them on! They showed great knowledge of what plants needed to grow. To make up for my trick I would love them to have some growing items for real, so they could grow some real plants from seed instead of mini marshmallows!  \n",

We have planted up smaller pots around school with our wildlife club's aid and we are looking next to improve and further our forest area. It is a small area but we would love to really boost the area so it can be used for learning and thrive as a minority woodland. We have further steps to bring back to life our sensory garden, hopefully with help from the wildlife club and Eco committee to maintain it, allowing the children to enjoy it through the summer and the Send and behavioural children to access it for sensory relief and calming throughout the day. We would love to get some shade onto our field area as our new secure fencing meant some of our little trees had to come down. Whether that be with new trees or for now shade sails, but we would love to create some willow tree hideouts and tunnels. There's a lot we would love to do on our Green journey. Any little would help as we start to bring sustainability and our environment into our focus in the classroom learning as well as in our day to day living at our school.</td>\n",

I would love to use this to set up a gardening club and begin growing vegetables that children can take home or use in a cooking club further along to provide them with life skills to provide for and nurture themselves. Much of what I provide comes from my own pocket as I'm sure we all do, to give these children experiences they may not otherwise have.   \n",
       "1002  We have climate change and the environment at our core at our school. We have fantastic Eco Warriors and very keen children. We litter pick, we recycle including food and we have next steps to compost and improve our green areas. We have planted up smaller pots around school with our wildlife club's aid and we are looking next to improve and further our forest area. It is a small area but we would love to really boost the area so it can be used for learning and thrive as a minority woodland. We have further steps to bring back to life our sensory garden, hopefully with help from the wildlife club and Eco committee to maintain it, allowing the children to enjoy it through the summer and the Send and behavioural children to access it for sensory relief and calming throughout the day. We would love to get some shade onto our field area as our new secure fencing meant some of our little trees had to come down. Whether that be with new trees or for now shade sails, but we would love to create some willow tree hideouts and tunnels. There's a lot we would love to do on our Green journey. Any little would help as we start to bring sustainability and our environment into our focus in the classroom learning as well as in our day to day living at our school.   \n",

Many of our children come from underserved backgrounds, this garden would offer a calming, educational environment that promotes wellness and curiosity. With your support, we could integrate garden-based lessons for our most vulnerable students, host family gardening days, and foster environmental stewardship for our next generation and turn a simple bundle into lasting growth for both students and their community.   \n",

We made posters about the process and even chose an area to grow them on! They showed great knowledge of what plants needed to grow. To make up for my trick I would love them to have some growing items for real, so they could grow some real plants from seed instead of mini marshmallows!\n",

Id also like to develop their physical skills, communication skills and links with nature by having resources to plant and grow their own plants and food. It would be so beneficial for them and following classes.\n",
       "11            Our school is wanting to set up a gardening club and Eco club which will run together. As a small school in a rural setting, this is important for us to encourage pupils to take care of the environment they live in and to develop their life skills through growing vegetable and understanding how to work as a team as well as all the other numerous lessons they will earn from these experiences. We will also encourage pupils to teach other children the skills they have acquired and promote the importance of everyone being involved in these projects this for the future of our world.\n",

       "40  Our gardening club is brilliant, but we never have enough gloves or resources. This would allow more children to experience planting/growing/caring for the crops they plant. From seed to full blossom. Our school is an Infant school and many of our children live in flats or small houses without gardens. Gardening club is often their only experience of growing things from scratch and nature. The crops grown are used for snack/cooking and brightening up the school, the children love to see the whole process and are really proud when the know that they have grown the food everyone is eating."
