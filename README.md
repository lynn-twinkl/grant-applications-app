# Community Collections Shortlisting App

This app was created to help the CC team at Twinkl more easily shorltist potential winners of Monthly Twinkl grants, prizes and giveaways without losing the quality of human touch.

All shortlisting alogrithms have been carefully modeled in collaboration with the team members responsible for reading and shortlisting applications in order to ensure the results stay as close to theirmanual work as possible.

In the first trials alone, the shortlists produced match the team's manual shortlists by at least 85%.
