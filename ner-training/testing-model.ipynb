      "In a recent email I sent to all staff at our school I highlighted the importance of outdoor learning. Being outside in a space where children can connect with nature, spark their curiosity, and unleash their creativity provides them with a wealth of skills. Access to green spaces is associated with improved mental well-being and overall health. It promotes improved memory, increases supportive social groups, and teaches self-discipline. It moderates stress and improves behaviours and symptoms of ADHD. Spending just 1-2 hours in nature can boost positive mood significantly. It decreases negative mood (tension, depression, and anger). Many of which our children feel or display characteristics of when starting the school day. \n",

It also fosters a sense of responsibility and stewardship for the environment as they understand the impact of sustainable practices for our planet. Being outdoors and growing your own teaches patience, resilience, and a sense of achievement.
