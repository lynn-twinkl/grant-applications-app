With your generous gardening bundle and the potential \u00c2\u00a3500 prize, we would create a 'Green Fingers Club' for our students, fostering a love for nature and gardening. This club would teach children to plant seeds, care for plants, and understand the life cycle of flora. The funds would purchase resources for our outdoor learning area, making it a year-round haven for hands-on science lessons. Your support would nurture lifelong sustainable habits and appreciation for the environment among our children.",
