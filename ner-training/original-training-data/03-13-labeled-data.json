Our parents and staff have formed a charity to support us, The Friends of Harford Manor. They work hard to raise funds to replace old equipment or items we break on accident which the schools limited budget cannot cover. As our charity is run 100% by volunteers every single penny goes to helping improve our quality of life. It is a challenge for SEN school to raise funds as many of our students live in various parts of the county. Any funds raised can could help us build a shelter for the back of classrooms to keep us dry or even for therapeutic resources that help us regulate throughout the school day. We often find ourselves competing with larger schools or academies with larger budgets and more resources, so every penny raised feels like a tiny miracle for us. We could really use funds at the moment to improve our school hall or to buy new swing seats for the secondary play area as the current ones are old, worn out, and ruining our students clothing with dark stains.
